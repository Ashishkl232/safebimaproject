                        <h2>Do kids need health insurance?</h2>
                        
                        <p><b>Many factors prompt you to buy health insurance for your kids. In this article, we discuss the various reasons why you must protect the health your children.</b></p>
                        <p>As a responsible parent, it is your duty to protect the well-being of your child in all walks of life. And since health is such a crucial aspect, you have to secure your child’s health. Health insurance for kids is as important as health insurance for any other family member. Take a look at the points mentioned below to know exactly why you need a good medical insurance plan for your children.</p>

                        <p><b>Reasons why kids need health insurance</b></p>
                        <p>Here are some of the main reasons why you should buy a good health plan for your child :</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Healthcare is Expensive :</strong> As we all know, health care costs are very expensive these days. Treating a simple ear infection can also cost you thousand of rupees. So you can quite imagine what a more complicated illness would cost! And since we always want to provide the best treatment to our children, buying insurance is the only option. With a health insurance plan in place, you can afford to take your child to the best hospital in the unfortunate event of an illness.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Protection D</b><b>uring&nbsp;Unfavourable Times</b>: Let us assume you lose your job. Along with it you not only lose your income but also your group health insurance coverage. What happens if your child falls ill during this period? We never think such incidents would strike us, but life is unpredictable and we have to take all the precautions. It therefore is vital for you to buy health insurance for kids and keep them protected always.</li>
                            <li><b>Preventive C</b><b>are</b>: Most health insurance plans for children cover vaccines, doctor consultation fees, medicines and OPD charges. This is a good reason to buy a health plan for your children. Children who have health insurance, for this reason, are seen to have better access to preventive healthcare and therefore lead healthier lives in general.</li>
                            <li><b>Children N</b><b>eed Constant Care:</b> It is true that an older person is more likely to get sick as compared to a child. However, children need constant medical care as their immune systems are weak. With exposure to infections at school, children are often seen to suffer from a wide range of diseases. Some of these are mild while some are serious, but all require medical attention. With a health insurance in place, you can always afford to address the small and big health issues of your child.</li>
                            <li><b>Protection </b> <b>in&nbsp;Your Absence</b>: If you die suddenly, your child will continue to stay protected under the health plan. This is a very big advantage. It assures you that even in your absence your child will be entitled to the best healthcare facilities.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p><b>Health Insurance for kids – An Absolute Necessity</b></p>
                        <p>It indeed is rightly said that children’s health insurance is a complete necessity. So if you have a young child at home, secure his or her health at the earliest. As you clearly saw from the points mentioned above, a good medical insurance plan protects the child from a number of unpleasant issues that can crop up at any time. Trouble often comes unannounced. And as we all know, prevention is better than cure. So buy a health insurance plan for your children and prevent the troubles from striking, as much as possible. Even if they do strike, be equipped to face them properly. Speak to your insurance agent and see what options are available in the kids’ health insurance department. Go through your requirements, choose an appropriate plan and keep your children safe at all times.</p>
