                        <h2>How to plan medical insurance for children?</h2>                  
                        <p><b>Kids need health insurance. These are reasons why it is important. Read on to know about the health plans for kids and how your child can benefit from them.</b></p>

                        <p>Medical insurance for children is important. No one, even in their worst dreams, imagines that their child will get sick. But misfortune strikes at times and the precious children do fall ill. To ensure they get the best treatment at the time of a medical emergency, health insurance for children is vital. Not only during an illness, the insurance cover can also work to prevent the child from getting serious illnesses in the first place. Take a look at this article to understand how a good health plan can keep your child protected.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Health insurance for children</b></p>
                        <p>There are no specific health insurance plans for children. However, a child can be included in a family floater health insurance plan as soon as she or she is born. Doing this would provide a good medical coverage for the child and take care of his or her medical issues. It, in fact, is important to do this. As we all know, healthcare costs are very expensive these days and without a medical coverage, you may not be able to afford the best treatment for your child. So include your child in a family floater plan at the earliest.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Advantages of getting medical insurance for children</b></p>
                        <p>Let us take a look at some of the advantages of buying health insurance for kids :</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><em><strong>Provides the best treatment options:</strong><br>
                            </em>Like mentioned above, medical expenses are high nowadays. If you have a health plan for your child you can take him or her to the best doctors at the biggest hospitals without worrying about the medical bills. This is perhaps the biggest advantage of medical insurance for kids.</li>
                            <li><strong><i>Helps </i> <i>in preventing diseases</i></strong><strong>:</strong><br>
                            Most health plans pay for the vaccines and OPD costs. This helps you in keeping your child well at  all times and preventing serious illnesses from striking.</li>
                            <li><strong><i>Added </i> <i>coverage</i></strong><strong>:</strong><br>
                            You may have the employer-provided group health coverage. However, if you lose your job or are in between jobs and your child falls sick at such a time, there is no medical insurance to fall back upon. A separate health plan for kids should, therefore, </span> be present at all times.</li>
                            <li><strong><i>Protection </i> <i>after your death</i></strong><strong>:</strong><br>
                            Are you worried that your children would not get the best healthcare facilities if you suddenly die? Well,  all you have to do is buy a family floater plan. Even if you die,  the policy will be transferred in the name of another family member and your children will continue to receive the same kind of medical cover. Wonderful, isn’t it?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><b>The best medical insurance plans for kids</b></p>
                        <p>There are some very good family floater health plans available from the private as well as public sector insurance companies in India. The plans offer some good benefits that work well to protect your child’s health. Compare the various available options to see what each plan offers and how they can be of help to you. Consider the needs of your child as well as the needs of the other family members when buying a family health insurance plan.</p>
                        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                        <p>Medical insurance for children is not an option; it is a compulsion. You cannot afford to leave the little darlings out of a good medical cover. As you can see from the points mentioned above, there are many reasons why children need a medical cover. So if you haven’t included them under a good health plan yet, do it right away. You can buy a health plan online or you can do it via your insurance agent.</p>
