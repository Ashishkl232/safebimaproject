                        <h2>All you need to know about health insurance for children</h2>
                        
                        <p>Health insurance is very important for children. Every child has a right to the best healthcare facilities. With a health plan, they can get this.&nbsp; An employer provided group insurance policy provides cover to everyone in your family including your children. But is this cover sufficient? Perhaps not. Keeping the rising healthcare costs in mind, you must buy a separate family floater plan. This would ensure your child gets the best healthcare facilities when the need arises. Your child is the most precious member of your family and definitely deserves the best care. So why not secure his health in the best possible manner?</p>
                        <p><b>What is health insurance for children?</b></p>
                        <p>Health insurance for kids works in the same way as they do for adults. There are no particular child health insurance plans but every child can be covered under a family health plan. The plan covers all the members of the family, including the children, under a common cover. So to ensure your child gets the best medical insurance, you have to buy a health cover that is large enough to cover the medical needs of your child as well as the other family members.</p>
                        <p><b>Why do children need a health cover?</b></p>
                        <p>Whether you have a very young kid at home or a slightly grown up child, you will be a pretty frequent visitor at the paediatrician’s office! The immunity system in a child is still developing and this exposes him or her to a whole lot of illnesses. A stimulus like a bacteria or a virus that falls flat on an adult body is capable of causing serious harm to a child’s body. To keep your child away from as many such perils as possible and to deal with a situation if he or she falls sick, you need to have the child’s health covered.</p>
                        <p>The medical insurance plans for kids usually pay for the vaccination charges. The vaccines are expensive but they are mandatory. You cannot stop your child from getting a vaccine even if you are low on the funds. To avoid being in any such situation, get a good health plan that will assist you financially at such times.</p>
                        <p>Falls and bruises are common in children, but at times these lead to serious complications and may even require surgery. A broken hand that requires surgery and physiotherapy thereafter can cost thousands of rupees. It will become very difficult for you to admit your child in a top hospital for the treatment without a good health plan in place.</p>

                        <p><b>Coverage in your absence</b></p>
                        <p>The greatest fear of a parent is providing for their children in their absence. Do you wonder what will happen if you die unexpectedly? Well, with a health plan in place, your children along with your other family members will continue to stay covered under the same plan even after your death. The policy will get transferred to your spouse’s name, but the facilities will remain the same. With so many health risks chasing us and stress and pollution taking away precious time from our lives, we can never predict when a misfortune will hit. So buy a health cover for your child while the sun still shines.</p>

                        <p><b>In a nutshell</b></p>
                        <p>To put it in a nutshell, there is no substitute for health insurance for children. As a responsible parent, it is your duty to buy a good plan to cover every single health requirement of your child. Thankfully, there are many health plans available these days and you can choose one that suits the needs of your children the best. Compare the options online to find the best health plan for kids at the best rate.</p>
