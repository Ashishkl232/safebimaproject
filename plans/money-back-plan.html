                            Money back plans provide both of savings and life cover. In this plans a certain amount of the 
                            sum assured is being given to the individual at regular intervals during the policy period. 
                            The balance amount is being paid during the maturity of the plan. If the policy holder dies 
                            during the policy period the nominee would get the sum assured as well as the bonus amount if 
                            any. Moreover the cash payout received at regular interval is exempted from tax. 
                            The amount of payout, terms of the policy, depends on the policy that one has opted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The major difference between an endowment and money back policy is endowment policies do not provide 
                            returns at regular intervals. Only the survival benefits are paid at the time of maturity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To explain further - The endowment plans pays the money, which includes the sum assured (or cover) and bonus, on the maturity of the policy. Money back policy, on the other hand, returns money usually as a fixed percentage of the sum 
                            assured to the insured during the term of the policy at some regular frequency (e.g. 5 years)

                                            Suppose a person takes a money back plan for 15 years with payouts of 25% of the total sum 
                                            assured after every five years and rest of the sum assured at the end of the 15th year along 
                                            with the additional bonus amount. So by the end of the 10th year the individual would have 
                                            received 50% i.e. 25*2=50% of the total sum assured and on the completion of the policy term, 
                                            the individual would have received 50% of the total sum assured plus any additional benefit if 
                                            any announced by the insurance company at the time the policy was bought. 
                                            The plan can also have higher term periods for ex: 20 or 25 years.

                                            Bonuses are declared at the end of the financial year. But, what if a policy matures or death occurs before the end of that period? Insurers declare interim bonus to take care of such situations and to avoid putting such policyholders at a disadvantage. 
                                            The amount of bonus, however, is added to the policy on pro-rata basis for that specific year.
