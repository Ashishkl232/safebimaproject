                        <p>Assuming a HCB of Rs.1000/- per day.</p>

                        <p>The premium is guaranteed to a period of 3 years from the date of initiation of policy. After the end of 3 years, LIC will review the premium as per the previous records and claims made during the period, and consider revising it (subject to approval of IRDA). If the premium is revised, it will be fixed again for another 3 years.</p>                       

                        <p><b>Benefits of this policy:</b></p>

                        <p><i>Hospitalization Cash Benefits</i> </p>

                        <p>Hospitalization cash benefit is a unique benefit provided to the insured in case of hospitalization disregarding the expenses he incurs on the treatment.</p>

                        <p><i>Ambulance benefit</i> </p>

                        <p>Up to Rs.1000/- ambulance charges will be provided to the insured in case of ambulance services obtained.</p>

                        <p><i>Major Surgical benefit</i> </p>

                        <p>If the insured undergoes a major surgery during the term of the policy, this policy will provide major surgical benefits which are 100 times the HCB. Suppose, the HCB is Rs.3000/- , then the MSB shall be Rs.3,00,000/-</p>

                        <p><i>Other surgeries</i> </p>

                        <p>If the insured undergoes medical treatment for surgeries not listed in the annexure relating to major surgical benefit or day care benefit, the policy will pay twice the HCB to the insured.</p>

                        <p><i>Premium waiver benefit</i> </p>

                        <p>Premium will be waived for a period of 1 year if the insured has undergone major surgery as per the annexure of major surgery of LIC.</p>

                        <p><i>Day care procedure benefit</i> </p>

                        <p>This benefit will be provided if the insurer avails listed day care procedure. This amount will be paid in lump-sum sum and is ideally, 5 times the HCB.</p>

                        <p><i>Term insurance rider and accident rider</i> </p>

                        <p>You can add the rider of term insurance (which is 100 times of HCB) and accident benefit rider which can be for a maximum value of the term insurance rider to your existing Jeevanarogya plan.</p>

                        <p><b>Disadvantage in this policy :</b> </p>

                        <p>The maximum limit of sum assured is Rs.4 lacs, which is inadequate keeping in mind the advancement in technology and inflation attached medical costs.</p>

                        <p>No benefit if you are hospitalized for less than 24 hours</p>

                        <p>Both parents/parent-in-law should be included (assuming they are live). You cannot insure only one of them.</p>

                        <p><b>Exclusions are :</b> </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pre-existing disease,</li>
                            <li>Any treatment not in nature of allopathy</li>
                            <li>Epidemic sickness</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>After reading this article, it would be easier to decide whether to buy this plan or leave it considering it suits your needs and is adequate after taking into account your current situation and future financial goals.</p>
