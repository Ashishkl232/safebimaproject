                        <h2>Senior citizen health coverage benefits with Star Health Insurance</h2>

                        <p>Mr. Jatin Trehan had recently retired. When out on a morning walk one day, he was hit by a scooter and fell on the road. The passersby rushed him to a nearby hospital where it was found that Mr. Trehan had fractured his ankle. With age not on his side, he was forced to go in for a surgery to fix his ankle. The real bolt came however when Mr. Trehan discovered he had no health insurance cover and had to pay the entire medical bill out of his own pocket. The helpless senior citizen had no option but to withdraw a large chunk of his life’s savings to clear the hospital bills.</p>

                        <p><b>Group insurance plans and retirement</b></p>

                        <p>A lot of people like Mr. Trehan are left uninsured overnight when they retire. The group health coverage ends as soon as the employee retires. While this is a given fact, many people don’t realise the gravity of the situation. It is therefore very important for every senior civilian to have an individual health plan as well. So if a situation similar to Mr. Trehan’s takes place, you can be secured.</p>

                        <p><b>Health insurance for senior citizens</b></p>

                        <p>While it is a good idea for you to buy health insurance earlier in life, you can still opt for a senior citizen health plan after you enter the golden sixtieth decade of your life. Some of the <b>best health insurance</b> providers of the country, like Star Health Insurance, offer some wonderful products that cater to your exact requirements. You can buy high coverage policies and stay protected against a number of illnesses.</p>

                        <p><b>Features and benefits of senior citizen health coverage with Star Health Insurance</b></p>

                        <p>Let us first take a look at the features of the highly acclaimed Star Senior Citizens Red Carpet Health plan :</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This policy can be bought by anyone in the age group of 60 and 74 years.</li>
                            <li>You won’t have to go for any medical screening tests before you buy the policy. This saves you a lot of time and energy.</li>
                            <li>A whole lot of pre-existing illnesses are covered under this plan. There is, however, a waiting period of 2 years before the pre-conceived illness coverage begins.</li>
                            <li>You can renew the policy after the age of 75 years.</li>
                            <li>OPD expenses are covered under this plan.</li>
                            <li>You can opt for a very high sum assured of up to Rs 10 lakhs. This is beneficial as with your age rising, the risk of contracting bigger health problems also rise.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>And here are some of the amazing benefits of the Star Senior Citizens Red Carpet Health Insurance :</p>

                        <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
                            <li>Pre hospitalisation, hospitalisation and post hospitalisation costs are covered under this plan.</li>
                            <li>You can get a claim for the ICU expenses (up to 2% of the sum insured).</li>
                            <li>You can also opt for certain diagnostic tests under this plan.</li>
                            <li>Day care expenses are also covered.</li>
                            <li>If you need to call an ambulance at the time of an emergency, you can reimburse the ambulance charges up to Rs 600 per hospitalisation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><b>Family floater plan options for senior citizens</b></p>

                        <p>There are other options for you as a senior civilian as well if you want to get a health plan. First and foremost, if your child is buying a health plan for the whole family, you can become a part of it as well, but most of these plans have a maximum entry age of 60 years. These plans are good for those people who promptly like to make a transformation from the group health plans to the individual plans immediately after they retire. You can get enrolled in such a plan a few years earlier as well and continue to stay protected for a long time after you retire. Star Health Insurance has some wonderful family health plans for you to consider.</p>

                        <p><b>The bottom line</b></p>

                        <p>The important thing to remember here is that you need health insurance coverage, more so if you are a senior resident. Your retirement days are wonderful and you must be able to relax and make the most of it, without having to worry about your health and finances. So buy a good senior citizen health plan from Star Health and stay protected against a long list of illnesses. The policy will take care of your medical requirements and you can live your life to the fullest.</p>
