                        <h2>New age medical plans with Tata AIG Health Insurance</h2>

                        <p>Vinod Dutta wanted to buy a health insurance plan. The decision was a sudden one and was prompted by his mother’s recent heart ailments. Mrs Dutta, a retired schoolteacher, had suffered a heart attack and spent a whole month in hospital thereafter. The doctors, though confident of her current health improvements, could not assure that a relapse wouldn’t occur in the future. Vinod only had a group insurance plan and he had to pay the majority of the medical bills from his pocket, for which he had to borrow money. He did not want to be in such a financially challenging situation ever again and so he promptly bought a Tata <b>AIG Health Insurance plan</b> for his whole family.</p>

                        <p>If you too are looking to buy a health plan, either for yourself or your whole family, consider the health plans from Tata AIG General Insurance.</p>
